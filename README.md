# OS-Process-Scheduling-in-Java

The **Process Scheduling Simulator** is a Java-based project that implements six essential **CPU scheduling algorithms**:  
- `FCFS` – First Come First Serve  
- `SJF` – Shortest Job First  
- `SRTF` – Shortest Remaining Time First  
- `RR` – Round Robin  
- `PNP` – Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)  
- `PP` – Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)  

This simulator takes a set of **processes with user-inputted details** such as **arrival time, burst time, priority, and time quantum (for RR)**. It then schedules the processes according to the selected algorithm and **generates a Gantt Chart** to visualize execution order. The program also computes **performance metrics** such as **turnaround time, waiting time, and response time** for each process.  


## Features  
- `Gantt Chart Visualization` – Draws a **Gantt Chart** to show the execution order of processes.  
- `Performance Metrics Calculation` – Computes **turnaround time, waiting time, and response time** for each scheduling algorithm.  
- `User Input Handling` – Accepts custom process details for dynamic scheduling.
